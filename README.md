Merry Christmas(?)

Back in 12/26/2023, I said in my discord server I would make 5 things after my Christmas vacaction was over, I think I got busy and forgot about it, so here's the boxes.

### 1.) 游꾸

- (unopened)

### 2.) 游꾸

- (unopened)

### 3.) 游꾸

- (unopened)

### 4.) 游꾸

### 5.) Fruit Ninja Mod

- While I was bored I thought of playing Fruit Ninja on my Nokia, I realized I couldn't play music while playing the game, so I modified the code and made it possible to listen to music as well.
- Also removed the ad banner because of course.
- Pretty sure I can't upload that on GitHub so you have to join [my discord server](https://discord.gg/W9DF2q3Vv2), and download it via [this message](https://discord.com/channels/971795243974406215/971795244553211961/1375871127112388769).
